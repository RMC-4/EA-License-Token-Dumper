# 🛠️ EA Denuvo Token Dumper

A lightweight **Windows tool** written in PowerShell and c++ (with chatgpt) that extracts the **Denuvo Token** from EA license files (`*.dlf`) and updates an `anadius.cfg` file automatically.  

This project is fully **open source** to reduce false positives and build trust — you can inspect the PowerShell code and build the executable yourself.

## 🚀 Usage

### PowerShell → EXE
1. Launch the tool:  
   - Run **`EA Denuvo Token Dumper.exe`**, or  
   - Open **`token_dumper.ps1`** with PowerShell  

2. Select your **license file** (`*.dlf`).  
   - Default location:  `C:\ProgramData\Electronic Arts\EA Services\License\16425677_sc.dlf`

3. (Optional) Select your **config file** (`anadius.cfg`).  
   - ✅ “Add DenuvoToken to anadius.cfg even if it exists”  
   - If checked → token will be written into `anadius.cfg`  
   - If unchecked → token is only shown in the app  

4. Click **Start** to extract the token.

### ⚡ Native C++ DLL
   - Especially made for FC26 Showcase version but could work with other title too (just need more tweaking)
   - Run with a dll injector or rundll32 **`ShowcaseTokenDumper.dll`**  
         OR
   - Add this line to anadius.cfg in Emulator section:  
        **"LoadExtraDLLsFromMain" "ShowcaseTokenDumper.dll"**

## 🔨 Build Instructions

### PowerShell → EXE
Want to build your own executable? Easy:

1. Install [ps2exe](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ps2exe):
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name ps2exe -Scope CurrentUser -Force
   ```

2. Build with:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-ps2exe .\token_dumper.ps1 ".\EA Denuvo Token Dumper.exe" -noConsole
   ```

3. The resulting `EA Denuvo Token Dumper.exe` will be in your folder.

### ⚡ Native C++ DLL
For those who prefer a native implementation, a C++ DLL version is included under the `native/` folder.

#### Dependencies
Dependencies are managed with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):

```bash
vcpkg install tinyxml2:x64-windows cryptopp:x64-windows
```

#### Build with CMake
```bash
cd native
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ^
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ^
      -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

This will output:
```
native/build/Release/ShowcaseTokenDumper.dll
```

The DLL can be loaded with `rundll32` or injected into another process.

## 🛡️ Security & False Positives
This project is not malware.  
Antivirus tools sometimes flag self-built PowerShell → EXE or DLL files due to heuristics.

✅ Source code is public and auditable  
✅ SHA256 hashes provided for every release  
✅ You can rebuild the binary yourself from source  

If you encounter false positives, please open an issue.
